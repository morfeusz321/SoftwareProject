Let’s go through the rubric once again and discuss what we should focus on during the last two weeks of the project.

## Notes

From us:

- what we’ve done to implement the feedback from our user tests
    - documented in our issues. things like: hover for information, renamed nodes, start node not deletable, more information, easier execution, things about removing
- what we’ve been doing
    - demo of functionality
- what can we do to finish our project up in the best way possible?
    - especially going through the

Feedback:

- we should have a section on software quality in the report, mention things like code coverage, why we decided on 70%, what kinds of tests we have
    - different quality assurance methods: types of tests, code assessment tools like lints, practices on GitLab
- initiative and creativity
- do we have to add something about collaboration to the report? not really, thats mostly graded by GitLab
- demo preferably live, will be during the presentation (20 minutes, then 40 min Q&A)
- add a section about usability to the report
- write more comments for methods, make the style consistent
- cleanup the issues to not have weights
- presentation on Monday in week 10
- it’s ok to have jokes during the presentation, just make sure it’s still professional and covers everything
