Notes:

- coach: will ask why we’re doing something, wants to see us doing the research part for things related to what TU Delft wants. project plan, midterm, end term. potentially final report draft too.

- project plan: can send to TA for feedback, can definitely send the project plan.

- technical part is someone else, not TA. TA mainly concerned with Process part of grading rubric. how we plan things, interactions, communication.

- research more important than previous things: why we’re doing stuff, giving arguments for our choices. problem analysis too.

- good that we already have some idea for why our project should exist, what problem it’s solving. 

- product part is mainly the expectation of the client, their input.

- meetings with TAs on Monday on 14:30 (?). 

- can add writing stuff as issues, to make division of tasks more clearly.

- for next week: talk about the project plan probably, one we have something we should demo. tell us how the week went, what the progress was. 

- we can send to TA: backlog, code of conduct 

- want to start by week 3 in the latest, probably earlier. 

- make sure we understand the problem, research.

- todo: CI/CD pipeline, good for this week.

- research: complicated, try to see how deep you can dig, specify their reasons for why something is good. good to discuss with coach, maybe he can point us towards more academic sources for some things maybe.

- for example, if we choose some framework X over Y, Z, W, good it include a paragraph about why we didn’t chose Y, Z, W.

- could include research about how we write code, idk some studies about code style or code smells or formatting
