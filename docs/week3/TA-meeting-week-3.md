Meeting agenda:
1. How are we doing? What did we do in week 3?
2. Sprint retrospective.
3. Question about the assignment for tomorrow - it requires e.g. ethics, technologies chosen, the problem and solution, but these are kind of separate sections in our report. do we just combine these for this assignment? so have like just sections 2, 3, 6 for example
4. Are we on track and what are our improvement areas.

## Meeting Notes
- opening: what did we do in week 3, what our retrospective is + action items
- unfortunately we don't have the project plan approved by the coach...

- presentation: monday at 15
- look at the midterm rubric: colors, process and product
- note: TA interested in process but mostly for product, process also with our client
- let Andrea know if we get feedback from the coach this week
- try to get agendas and docs for week 3 before the week 4 
- individual description vs definition of done: what should happen vs something like "it should be approved and well tested and formatted and documented"
- we can do a demo
- testing: on front-end not that much right now because it's changing so fast, selenium end-to-end testing not planned right now, currently focusing on unit tests
- move incomplete issues for week 3 to week 4, also close remaining issues!
- pushing: try to wait with pushing until the pipeline will pass
- code reviews: room for improvement, potentially be a bit more active / have everyone 
- documentation: pretty solid for the back-end, autogenerated, allows easy viewing of endpoints and testing endpoints; also doing normal line comments
- demo of what we we have so far; mostly on the front-end but the front-end is sending the correct requests
- things to focus on:
	- code going good
	- more about gitlab: comments, tests, pipelines 
	- good that we have milestones and labels and points
	- improve impelentation detail for issues and definition of done (see above)
	- move leftover issues at the end of the sprint
	- good that we have retrospective, make sure to upload on gitlab, also potentially add more info about 
	- work on documentation 
	- tests pretty ok but more is good ofc
	- code reviews: between being not that helpful and helpful, can improve
	- notes: they exist but work on readability, such that you can look  at them in the future and understand
