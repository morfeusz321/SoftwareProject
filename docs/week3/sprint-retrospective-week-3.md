Sprint Retrospective 12.05

1. Review sprint details:
    - Sprint goals:
        - Frontend: Basic functionality and interfaces
        - Backend: Basic functionality
    - Key deliverables:
        - Functioning graph editor and menu
        - Controller for graph on backend and tests
2. Insights and observations:
    - What went well during the sprint?
        - We have implemented major part of frontend functionalities,
        - Backend splitting responsibilities
    - What didn't go well?
        - Frontend and backend coordination turned out to have some flaws
        - Frontend issue distribution could be improved as to the workload and subdividing issues into smaller parts.
    - Any issues or obstacles faced?
        - Team - general
            - Frontend and backend misunderstanding causes additional work
            - New material caused the work to be prolonged.
        - Member specific:
            - Piotr - I got pretty stuck on a simple error.
            - Rafal - Problems with figuring out a clever way of implementing schedule and stuck with edges not showing
            - Filip B - Lack of communication when developing causing need for changing code
            - Filip P - The main back-end ticket (graph controller+execution) ended up larger than expected, especially given the backend-frontend design confusion.
3. Improvement areas:
    - Frontend - Backend communication
    - Rafal - Not being afraid to ask other team members for a date
    - Laimonas - when stuck or brainstorming for too long ask others for input
    - Filip B - Better communication with other teammates
    - filip p - coordination of desing, basically backend-frontend communication
4. Action items:
    1. When stuck - ask for help.
    2. Include “learning process” into issue planning
