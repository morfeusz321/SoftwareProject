# Week 2

- [x]  Didn’t really do much because we only had 1 working day between the meetings,
- [x]  Let’s discuss feedback you have on CoC and MosCow
- [x]  Present our project plan
- [x]  We have discussed design/ UML
- [x]  We work on CI/CD and Docker
- [x]  Research: (how do we put that into report?) what form should it have, could you give an example? Are those good fields?
    1. ~~Usability of the graph~~
    2. ~~How to store graph (and why json with coordinates)~~
- [x]  Do we put schedule into project plan
- [x]  Should we schedule issues upfront or rather adjust on the fly

Project plan - think about the whole cycle of project development

Monday 22.05 midterm presentation

Invite client

totally get a coffee with coach; can also ask him about things wrt. research

don’t include schedule

it’s fine not to plan everything up front

~~Issue template (def of done etc)~~

can work on project plan after the deadline, grading not isolated such that it’s like an isolated assignment with a single grade

good to take into account usability (also later in evaluation of product can run usability tests? more for the final report)
