2. Insights and observations:
    - What went well during the sprint?
        - We have managed to complete all of the tasks required for  week 2. We were well organized and proved that we function and communicate well as a team. Also Liam had his dentist appointment.
    - What didn't go well?
        - The ticket distribution was to fragmented and that resulted in unnecessary merge conflicts. Something that could easily be done as one issue was divided into two causing only problems.
    - Any issues or obstacles faced?
        - CI/CD setup took longer than expected.
3. Improvement areas:
    - Manage issue distribution better.
4. Action items:
    - Spend more time on distributing issues next Tuesday.
