Week 4
Sprint Retrospective 19.05
Review sprint details:
Sprint goals: Core functionality of the application - connecting frontend and backend
Key deliverables: Frontend and backend are connected
Insights and observations:
What went well during the sprint?
We got a lot done. We were able to finally perform execution of the graph.
We were efficient at communicating when we had misunderstandings about how thing should be implemented.
We’ve improved our process for code reviews and comments. We’ve also improved our issues, making our definitions of done more specific and separate from what functionality should be implemented.
What didn't go well?
Tasks were related to each other so we had more merge conflicts and problems with efficiently working in parallel than previously (but being in person helped with this a lot).
Member Specific:
Piotr - I encountered a bug that was a result of lack of understanding of particular tool, IO tried to use it without fully going through it.
Filip P - Not much, for me this was the smoothest sprint so far. Knew what I had to do and got it implemented in a reasonable amount of time.
Filip B - When connecting the frontend with the backend there were differences in the way we represent some variables (like frontend was using camelcase when backend was using capital letters and etc).
Rafał - I was stuck for a long time with the leader-line library and wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what was the issue with the edges not displaying. We also had some naming differences FE/BE, probably lacking some communication regarding naming.
Any issues or obstacles faced?
Naming convention was not decided - some issues with British English and American English
Improvement areas:
Make sure to discuss all of the conventions upfront.
Issue distribution
Action items:
Think about how do the issues relate to each other.
Agree on naming convention
