3. Discuss the results of usability tests and what do we agree to improve.

Users were put into complete black box scenario. After short instructions they improved a lot.

Results:

1. Trigger node:
    1. It is not clear that it is also a start node - rename it, and preferably put it in the graph by default.
2. Adding and connecting edges and nodes:
    1. Users would like a functionality to add nodes by clicking them or dragging - the nodes in scrollbar look like buttons.
    2. It is not clear how to delete or add an edge.
    3. It would be more intuitive if adding new nodes would be done in “add to already existing node manner”.
    4. Or maybe add a starting point for the edge to connect.
3. We should add some kind of functionality for the users to execute the graph from graph builder.
4. We miss a message that inform that saving of a graph wasn’t successful.
5. Difference between ‘save’ and ‘save as draft’ is not clear to the users.
6. Improve node info - preferably add names, because reference is not clear enough. Also maybe show the data that the node stores.
7. Improve the layout of buttons used in the node editor - bigger button should draw more attention

1. Condition nodes:
    1. The description in the filter node was not clear. Names are not specific enough.
    2. Filter is heavy - a lot of info
2. Action nodes:
    1. Description for passing the data into body was not clear.
    2. Description of what argument is wasn't clear.
    3. Forgot to add argument after entering it to Json body. - maybe some kind of check to prevent this.
3. User clicked on "edit" while trying to connect the nodes.
4. User confused "add argument button.
5. User didn't know the proper format of JSON.
6. Some sort of debugger - step by step what data is stored inside each node.
7. Rename arguments or think about description
8. Users didn’t always save changes. Maybe a pop out?

1. Accidently deleted a node
2. Time zone for trigger node
3. Make selecting the parent more explicit

1. Clicking edge - deleting
2. I would expect clicking the node to open the edit screen, rather than adding arrows.
3. make it a button instead of a hidden functionality
4. didn't think of that but after figuring it out it was ok

1. Arguments - are not descriptive enough.
2. Better handling for json field - add brackets, format, etc.

1. Better descriptions and positioning of the forms.
2. Compare against is confusing
3. In general improve names and try to make it more intuitive for the users to work with.

1. Execution of a graph.
2. Wasn’t aware that the side menu existed.

What should we improve on?

1. Preferably add more visual way of displaying information - as it is now - forms are text heavy.
2. More descriptions, examples, tutorials, information, context

Difference between save and save as draft.

1. After user got there, it was very simple.
2.

## Notes

- we only got 10 responses but it was enough to get some very concrete and useful feedback
- going over the forms and what tasks we did
- most important points on the user tests and the received feedback
    - loading screen
    - page for new graph creation feels empty, too much negative space
    - observation: users were seeing the application for the first time, but they got noticeably better at using the application over time
    - not clear that the **trigger** is a start node! the solution we liked is to have the trigger node in the graph by default
    - nodes look like buttons! **users tried to click the nodes** instead of drag and dropping
    - not clear how to **delete or add an edge** at first; maybe add a separate button for adding and clicking to delete
    - adding nodes should potentially be different: always appending new nodes to an existing graph instead of adding nodes and then connecting them
    - it should be possible to execute the graph from the builder!
    - the **forms** have a lot of text, difficult to understand at a glance.
    - pop up about unsaved changes when leaving the graph editor
    - accidental **deletion**, button easy to miss-click
    - **labels** not very intuitive, maybe change the names
    - time zones for trigger schedule potentially: at least specify which time zone we are using, then users can adjust on their own
- good to prioritise things which are impossible to recover from, like node deletion, since having that be unintuitive could be very frustrating
- summary of what we did this week and retrospective conclusions, showcase of test coverage reports

### Github

- time estimates and weights a bit inconsistent, try to work on this
- we should go back and try to improve the previous issues
- if we have some sort of rule for assigning weights then we should make it explicit and put it into the code of conduct or report
