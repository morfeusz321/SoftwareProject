## Shared team values
1. Quality of our product: We strive to create a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly Insocial Flow Builder that meets our client's requirements.
2. Organization of our work: We value a well-structured and planned approach to our project, ensuring timely completion and efficient collaboration among team members.
3. Atmosphere in our team: We believe in fostering a positive, supportive, and respectful team environment that encourages open communication, learning, and growth.

## Assignment description
As a group in this course, we need to develop the Insocial Flow Builder, a user-friendly tool that allows Insocial customers and non-IT skilled individuals to connect their systems with the Insocial API easily. Our responsibilities include designing the graphical user interface, developing the backend services, and integrating the flow builder with the Insocial platform while ensuring it is secure, reliable, and easy to use.

## Target or ambition level
As a team, we have decided that we aim for a grade between 8.5 and 9.5. We will strive to produce high-quality work that demonstrates our understanding of the subject matter, showcases our technical skills, and meets the client's requirements.

## Products
At the end of the course, we will deliver a functional Flow Builder that meets the key features specified by the client, a comprehensive project plan, final report and a final presentation. We will share documents and files using Gitlab and Notion, use Slack for discussion and communication, and Lucidchart for brainstorming and visualization. The submitted work must meet the course's quality and formatting standards.

## Planning
We will create a detailed project plan with milestones and deadlines for each team member to ensure timely completion of tasks. We ensure that tasks are clearly divided into issues to ensure that tasks can be done as independently as possible. We give the last say in the final deliverable to Filip Błaszczyk, and responsibility for uploading required documents to Brightspace to Piotr Bieszczad.

## Behaviour
We will treat each other with respect and professionalism. We will address disagreements constructively and seek consensus. Our coach and TA could be involved in reaching consent if needed, but this will be used as a last resort. If someone is late during a group meeting, they will notify the group in advance and catch up on missed information. The penalty for being late for a meeting is n² push-ups (where n is number of minutes late) with an upper bound of 50.

For coding we will follow a strict commit naming pattern consisting of FIX, FEAT, CHORE, TASK at the start of the commit. Merge requests will also have a prefix like FE, BE, FS, Investigation to keep a nice and understandable structure of what was done.

## Communication
We will communicate using Slack for group discussions and upload documents such as to-do lists and meeting notes to Notion. Our meetings will be primarily held in person at the Insocial office. If an online meeting is required, we will use Discord.

## Commitment
We will determine the quality of work by evaluating adherence to project requirements, code quality, and documentation standards. The code should be thoroughly reviewed before merging. Each merge request should receive at least 2 approvals before being merged. The approvers are obliged to test and review the code.

## Division of Tasks and Roles

For the TA meetings we have decided for Piotr to be the chairman and Filip P. to be a notetaker. As for the project part, we won’t have a strict division of roles, as we want different team members to gain experience with different aspects of the development process.

## Meetings
Regarding management and planning, we will follow the Agile Workflow with daily stand upat 11. Each team member should come prepared with updates on their tasks and any relevant information to share with the group. We have also arranged weekly meetings with the client on Fridays. If someone is unable to physically attend we will try to meet online.

## Decision-making
We will make decisions by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, we will resort to a majority vote. We will follow the principle of decentralization in our decision-making process, aiming to resolve problems as locally as possible while acknowledging those issues that need to be brought to the group's attention due to their relevance.

## Dealing with Conflicts
We will handle conflicts within the group through open communication, understanding, and seeking a resolution that benefits the entire group. Any difference of ideas should be discussed and used to reach the best and most optimal solution.

## Guidance
We expect guidance from the teacher and/or student assistant on both the content and the collaboration aspects of the project. We appreciate constructive feedback that helps us improve our work and team dynamics.

## Consequences
If a participant in the group does not keep the agreements, the issue will be addressed within the group. If the problem persists, we may involve the team’s coach or TA for further assistance.

## Success Factors
Our dream team consists of dedicated, skilled, and cooperative individuals who communicate effectively, support each other, and work together to overcome challenges.
