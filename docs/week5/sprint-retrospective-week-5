2. Insights and observations:
    - What went well during the sprint?
        - Final presentation went pretty good. We have received a green flag.
        - We have applied the feedback, merge request checklist is way more useful now.
    - What didn't go well?
        - We had a couple of ‚Äúhanging‚Äù merge requests and unused branches.
    - Any issues or obstacles faced?
        - Piotr - I overcomplicated design of a component, which made it harder to get it to work.
        - Filip - The definition of one task changed so I had to rethink how we will achieve graph execution just using our app.
        - Jack - Main task for the week went smooth. Last small task with documentation generation was really annoying because PHP annotations are cursed and poorly documented.
        - Rafa≈Ç - New technology caused some problems and thus assigned issue took a bit longer than expected. Also PHP is really painful and I miss my frontend üò¢
        - Liam - Frontend testing is just painful

4. Action items:
